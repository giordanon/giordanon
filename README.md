### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at Kansas State University. My current area of research aims to determine agronomic, genetic, human, and social aspects of sustainably reducing wheat yield gaps. 

Iâ€™m enthusiastic about using Bayesian statistics as a tool towards probabilistic inference for agriculture challenges!
